ParkEasy is an app to monitor Parking Spots at a given location, where several Parking Lots are present. The Parking Spots can be in three different states: Available, Reserved, and Occupied. 

The application is available as a Mobile App and as a Web App. It is connected to luminosity sensors present on each physical Parking Spot with a threshold of 20% of luminosity: over 20% of light sensed means the Parking Spot is Available, else it is Occupied. 

In each Folder is another README file explaining in more details the corresponding part.
